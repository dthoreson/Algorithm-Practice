//PARTITION AND QUICKSORT - W11D24

/* 
    Visualization:
    https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/algorithms/sorting/quick-sort/visualize/
    Create a function that uses yesterdayâ€™s partition to fully sort an array
    in-place.
    Unstable sort.
    
    Time Complexity
        - Best: O(n log(n)) linearithmic.
        - Average: O(n log(n)) linearithmic.
        - Worst: O(n^2) quadratic.
    
    Space: O(1) constant.
    Params: nums, left, right
    - left and right are indexes, for now, left will be 0, and right will be the
        last idx.
    - later these params will be used to specify a sub section of the array to
        partition.
    Steps:
    - start by partitioning the full array
        (use the previously built partition algo).
    - then partition the left side of the array
        (left of the returned partition idx) and the right side
        (right of the returned partition idx), recursively.
